# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. In Python, we do not use parentheses and curly brackets, we use indentation with tabs or spaces

# create function
def sayHello(name):
    print(f'hello {name}')

# return values
def getSum(num1, num2):
    total = num1 + num2
    return total


# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. Very similar to JS arrow functions

getsum2 = lambda num1, num2 : num1 + num2
